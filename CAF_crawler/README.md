This indicates that the webpage allows all robots complete access. However, this project **DOES NOT** collect any personal information or any other sensitive information, but only publicly available titles of careers listed on the [CAF website](https://forces.ca/).

## What is this project?
I often visit the CAF website to look at the different careers currently in demand, as I am interested in enlisting in the near future.


This project seeks to automate the collection of the indemand career titles, helping me see what the general trend is of the jobs currently being recruited for.



## What does this project use?
This project is made using Python.
